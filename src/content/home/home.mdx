> Implement a polyfill for Promises in the browser which works for ie8


Okay, so not knowing this question is totally fine. It does not make you a bad developer. 
More over most of the times if you are asking to implement something like this, you'd 
probably copy something from Stack overflow or some blog site on Google. I realise 
people may get intimidated by core JS questions during interviews, and not knowing some of it at that moment
isn't a testament to how you are . Nevertheless a company's bench mark 
are such questions.
