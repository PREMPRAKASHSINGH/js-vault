## JS Vault

[JS Vault](https://jsvault.com)

This site is a collection of tricky JS questions which have been asked to people,
At the moment there are barely 10-15 questions which i have beeen able to collect,
although i would love more contribution.

The site is made with [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) and bootstrapped by [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) CD is used for deployment

If you wish to add more questions , you can start by adding one to the `content` directory,
and adding a route in `routes.js`. That's all

```jsx
<Editor />
```

You can drop in an Editor component for creating a playground.


### For Development
```bash
yarn start
```
